# Website Improvement Rules - MVP Phase

## Priority 1: Content Structure & Hierarchy

### Hero Section Enhancement
- Replace current title with: "Transform Your Child's Academic Journey with Expert, Individualized Support"
- Add subtitle: "Personalized tutoring, test prep, and college counseling for students of all learning styles and abilities"
- Move key credentials (Brown University, NYU M.Ed.) to be visible immediately under the title

### About Section Restructuring
- Break the large "About Marissa" paragraph into 3 distinct sections:
  1. **Background & Credentials** (2-3 sentences)
  2. **Unique Experience** (professional ballet background, 20 years education)
  3. **Current Practice** (remote work, international clients)
- Limit each section to 2-3 sentences maximum

### Add Essential Sections (in order)
1. **Services Overview** - 4 clear categories with brief descriptions:
   - Academic Coaching (all subjects, K-12+)
   - Standardized Test Prep (list key tests: SAT, ACT, SSAT, etc.)
   - College Admissions Counseling (essays, applications, school selection)
   - Executive Functioning Support (organization, time management, study skills)

2. **Specializations** - Bullet points:
   - Gifted and neurodiverse learners
   - Students with ADHD, anxiety, and learning differences
   - IEP support and advocacy
   - ESL students seeking academic advancement

## Priority 2: Typography & Visual Hierarchy

### Font & Spacing Rules
- Main title: Larger, bold weight
- Section headers: Medium size, consistent styling
- Body text: Reduce current font size by 10-15%
- Add 1.5x more white space between sections
- Consistent line height: 1.6 for readability

### Color & Design Consistency
- Extend the green accent color to all section headers
- Add subtle background color variation between sections (light gray/white alternating)
- Ensure consistent margins and padding throughout

## Priority 3: Professional Polish

### Content Voice Standardization
- Use third person consistently throughout (avoid switching to first person)
- Remove any informal language or placeholders
- Maintain professional but warm tone

### Trust Signal Enhancement
- Create a dedicated "Credentials" highlight box with:
  - Brown University B.A. (English & American Literature, Honors)
  - NYU M.Ed. (Education)
  - Columbia University Publishing Program
  - 20+ years experience
- Add "Remote sessions available worldwide" as a key differentiator

### Call-to-Action Addition
- Add one primary CTA button: "Schedule a Free Consultation"
- Place after the Services Overview section
- Use the green accent color for the button

## Implementation Notes

### Structure Priority
1. Fix hero section first
2. Restructure About section
3. Add Services Overview
4. Apply typography improvements
5. Add CTA button

### Design Guidelines
- Maintain current layout structure (don't redesign completely)
- Keep the dog photo but ensure it doesn't overshadow professional content
- Focus on readability and clear information hierarchy
- Mobile-friendly considerations (readable on phones)

### Content Guidelines
- Every section should answer "What's in it for the parent/student?"
- Use active voice where possible
- Include specific details (test names, age ranges, etc.) for credibility
- Avoid jargon - write for parents who may not be familiar with education terminology

## Success Metrics for MVP

## Future Iteration Ideas (Phase 2)
